strings, bytes, bytearrays
tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries containing only picklable objects
functions defined at the top level of a module (using def, not lambda)
built-in functions defined at the top level of a module

instances of such classes whose __dict__ or the result of calling __getstate__() is picklable
(see section Pickling Class Instances for details).
